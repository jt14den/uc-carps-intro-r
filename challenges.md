### Challenge 1: Creating a self-contained project

We're going to create a new project in RStudio:

1.  Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2.  Click "New Directory".
3.  Click "New Project".
4.  Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g.
    "my_project".
5.  If available, select the checkbox for "Create a git repository."
6.  Click the "Create Project" button.

-   simplest way to open rstudio and a project is thru your file system
    by double clicking on the `.Rproj` file in your poject folder.

### Challenge 2: Opening an RStudio project through the file system

1.  Exit RStudio.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you created a project in
    Challenge 1.
3.  Double click on the .Rproj file in that directory.

### Challenge 3 
Which of the following are valid R variable names? (Add a plus after the correct answer(s))

min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin


### Challenge 4

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the
following program?

mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20

### Challenge 5

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare
`mass` to `age`. Is `mass` larger than `age`?

### Challenge 6

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `gapminder`

### Challenge 7

Start by making a vector with the numbers 1 through 26. Multiply the vector by 2, and give the resulting vector names A through Z (hint: there is a built in vector called LETTERS)

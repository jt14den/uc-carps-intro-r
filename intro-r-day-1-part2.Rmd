## Data Frames and Subsetting

Part 2 of the workshop. Start at 'Realsitic Example' <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/05-data-structures-part2/index.html#realistic-example>

We are going to use the datafile that you downloaded into your project data folder.

There are at least three different ways to read in data:


1) read the file from your data folder

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

2) download the file in-code and then read in
```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/main/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")

gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

3) read directly from the internet
```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/main/data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```


Lasty, if you have a file type you're not sure about (SAS, SPSS, etc) you can use the 'Import Dataset'from the RStudio interface.

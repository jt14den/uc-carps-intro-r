## Motivation 

* Research is a multistage process
* We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. 
* This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing population information for many countries through time. 
* By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!


## Setup 

* Do you have RStudio & R installed? 

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Setup - communications

### Guidelines

-   Zoom chat can be used to ask questions or provide comments or
    express difficulties during the lesson. Type "hand" in the chat, or
    type the question into the chat, or use a "raise hand". To request
    assistance, message helper or indicate the red x "no" in the
    participants chat.
-   Helpers may continue to reply there or via zoom private chat as
    needed.
-   If necessary, helpers may temporarily move to a zoom breakout room
    with you to discuss in details using audio/screen sharing. You can
    return to the main session by leaving the breakout room.
-   You can participate in the polls during the lesson by clicking Zoom
    Participants Panel and clicking on yes/no.
-   For a single screen, it can be split to have the zoom window and the
    window where we'll be working, both open side by side.
-   Please rename yourself to add the Operating System (OS) after your
    name in zoom. e.g. Annajiat (Linux)
-   Having a Great Online Learning Experience: A Guide for Students,
    <https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/great-online-learning-student>

* You can then ask each learner to share their name, pronouns, and institution or location verbally, or have them type it in the chat. On Zoom, learners can adjust their screen name to reflect their preferred name and pronouns.

## Motivation

-   Research is a multistage process
-   We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
    how to plot results graphically.
-   This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing
    population information for many countries through time.
-   By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot
    the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!

## Setup

### Do you have RStudio & R installed?

-   [Download and install the latest version of R
    here](https://www.r-project.org/)
-   [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Intro to RStudio

![Rstudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/01-rstudio.png)

![Rstudio](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-r/fig/RStudioPanes.png) \#\#
Workflow in RStudio

### Two main styles:

1.  Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a
    .R file to run later.
2.  Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the
    Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified
    lines to the interactive R console.

Let's start off testing n playing and then transition to working in
scripts

## Using R as a calculator

Simplest thing is math:

```{r}
1 + 100

```

Like bash if you type incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete:

```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 
```

If you want to cancel out of this, hit the <kbd>esc</kbd>.

## Math Functions

-   R has many built in mathematical functions.
-   To call a function, we can type its name, followed by open and
    closing parentheses

![Functions in
R](https://science.nu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-8.png)

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

-   Hey what if i want to add up some numbers?

```{r}
sum(1, 3, 4)
```


## Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than

```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

```{r}
0.1 == 0.1
```

## Project Management: RStudio

-   The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
    start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
    eventually everything is a bit mixed together.
-   Projects can get really messy:

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/bad_layout.png)

**A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:**

-   It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
-   It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else (a
    lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
-   It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript
    submission;
-   It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.
-   One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its
    project management functionality.
-   We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
    project.

### Challenge 1: Creating a self-contained project

We're going to create a new project in RStudio:

1.  Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2.  Click "New Directory".
3.  Click "New Project".
4.  Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g.
    "my_project".
5.  If available, select the checkbox for "Create a git repository."
6.  Click the "Create Project" button.

-   simplest way to open rstudio and a project is thru your file system
    by double clicking on the `.Rproj` file in your poject folder.

### Challenge 2: Opening an RStudio project through the file system

1.  Exit RStudio.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you created a project in
    Challenge 1.
3.  Double click on the .Rproj file in that directory.

## Creating an R Script

-   now we have our project set up we can create an R script!
-   Go to <kbd>File</kbd><kbd>New File</kbd><kbd>R Script</kdb>
-   ok who can tell me what a R Script is for?
-   yes, we write our R code in it and it lets us run that code in a few
    ways
-   we save our code in the file, etc.
-   let's add some code and learn how to use R Scripts in RStudio

## Variables and assignment

-   We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`,
    like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

-   note that it doesn't print anything out to the console.
-   stored it for later in something called a **variable**. `x` now
    contains the value 0.025:

```{r}
x
```

-   the stored value is a decimal approximation of this fraction called
    a floating point number.

-   did you notice anything change in the RStudio interface when we
    saved the variable?

    -   type into the chat what you noticed

-   Yes, under the Environment tab on the right we see `x` was added
    with it's stored values

-   We can use our variable in a function

```{r}
log(x)
```

-   Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

-   x used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

-   Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to, like
    so:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

-   The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.

-   The right hand side is fully evaluated before the assignment occurs.

-   Variable names:

    -   Can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no
        spaces.
    -   They must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter
        (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore).
    -   **Variables beginning with a period are hidden variables**.

-   Different people use different conventions for long variable names,
    these include:

-   periods.between.words underscores_between_words

-   camelCaseToSeparateWords

-   What you use is up to you, but be consistent.

It is also possible to use the = operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

-   this is much less common in the R community. but be consistent

## R Packages

-   how to load and a challenge to load packages we'll need today and
    tomorrow
-   It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
    obtaining a package written by someone else.
-   As of this writing, there are over 18,000 packages available on CRAN
    (the comprehensive R archive network).
-   R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:
-   You can see what packages are installed by typing
    `installed.packages()`
-   You can install packages by typing
    `install.packages("packagename")`, where packagename is the package
    name, in quotes.
-   You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
-   You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
-   You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`
-   Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages
    tab of the lower right panel in RStudio.
-   Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with
    a checkbox next to them.
-   If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded
    and if it is empty, the package is not loaded.
-   Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to
    detach that package.
-   Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the
    Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.

Let's work through some challenges: 

### Challenge 3

Which of the following are valid R variable names? (Add a plus after the correct answer(s))

```{r, eval=FALSE}
min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin
```

### Challenge 4

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the
following program? (try guessing before running in R yourself)

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

### Challenge 5

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare
`mass` to `age`. Is `mass` larger than `age`?

### Challenge 6

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `gapminder`

## Data Structures

### Data types in R

-   variables we create have types:
-   we can find out this by using `typeof()`:

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(3.14)
```

-   There are 5 main types: double, integer, complex, logical and
    character.

```{r}
typeof(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
```

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
```

```{r}
typeof('bannana')
```

### Vectors

-   Working with a single value is one thing, but in R we are typically
    working with collections of values in something like a speadsheet
-   R lets us put a column of values together in something called a
    `vector`
-   vectors in R are foundational
-   Let's meet this vector
-   We can create a vector
-   I'll use the `c()` to create one

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 4, 5)
my_vector
```

-   A vector in R is an ordered list of things, with the special
    condition that everything in the vector must be the same basic data
    type.
-   If you don't choose the datatype in the vector function, it'll
    default to logical; or, you can declare an empty vector of whatever
    type you like.

```{r}
another_vector <- c('Tim', 'Jamie', 'Maddi')
another_vector
```

-   You can check if something is a vector:

```{r}
str(another_vector)
```

-   this command indicates the basic data type found in this vector - in
    this case chr, character;

-   an indication of the number of things in the vector - actually, the
    indexes of the vector, in this case [1:3];

-   and a few examples of what's actually in the vector - in this case
    empty character strings. If we similarly do

-   **Given what we've learned so far, what do you think the following
    will produce?**

```{r}
quiz_vector <- c(2,6,'3')
quiz_vector
```

```{r}
str(quiz_vector)
```

-   why do you think R did this?

-   yes, vectors in R need to be of the same type & R will coerce them

-   This is something called type coercion, and it is the source of many
    surprises and the reason why we need to be aware of the basic data
    types and how R will interpret them.

-   When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to be
    combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same
    type. Consider:

-   The coercion rules go: `logical` -\> `integer` -\> `numeric` -\>
    `complex` -\> `character`, where -\> can be read as are transformed
    into. You can try to force coercion against this flow using the as.
    functions:

```{r}
as.numeric(quiz_vector)
```

```{r}
quiz_vector <- as.numeric(quiz_vector)
```

### Vectorized

-   when you have vectors, you can run operations over all of them at
    once
-   like we can multiple 2 over each of our `quiz_vector`

```{r}
quiz_vector * 2
```

-   We can save that as a new vector

```{r}
quiz_double_vector <- quiz_vector * 2
quiz_double_vector
```

-   this ability to run an operation over all elements in a vector is
    called **vectorization**
-   it's built into R and makes R very powerful because we don't have to
    write loops to do this

### Series & sequences

* in R we can create a sequence by using the `:` operation 
* it means create a vector from the first number to the next by an increment of 1

```{r}
1:5
```

* we can save this out as a vector in our environment:

```{r}
series_vec <- 1:5
```


* if we want to control the step in our sequence, we can use the R funciton `seq`

```{r}
seq(2, 10, 2)
```

* this means i want a sequence from 2 to 10 by 2
* we can assign this to a variable as well

## Dataframes

-   We said that columns in data.frames were collection of vectors
-   DF columns as individual vectors
-   let's show this by creating a data frame

```{r}
df_example <- data.frame(another_vector, my_vector, quiz_vector)
```

-   We can print out a data frame like we do variables

```{r}
df_example
```

-   additionally in RStudio we can view the data frame in a separate tab
    in RStduio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(df_example)
```

-   You can also open this view in the environment pane by clicking on
    the data frame name

-   We can also look at the structure of the data frame with the `str`
    function:

```{r}
str(df_example)
```

-   note this shows you the name of the vectors in the data frame, their
    type and number of observations or rows
-   you can get the same info if we unfurl the arrow next to the data
    frame in the environment
-   Break

## Terms

**Factors:** the data objects which are used to categorize the data and
store it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are
useful in the columns which have a limited number of unique values.
These would be used in datasets that have demographic data such as age,
sex, political party, etc

**Vectors**: Vector is a basic data structure in R.\
- contains element of the same type. - Ttypehe data types can be
logical, integer, double, character, complex or raw.

A vector's type can be checked with the typeof() function.

Another important property of a vector is its length. This is the number
of elements in the vector and can be checked with the function length().

## Data Frames and Subsetting

Part 2 of the workshop. Start at 'Realsitic Example'
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/05-data-structures-part2/index.html#realistic-example>

We are going to use the datafile that you downloaded into your project
data folder.

### There are at least three different ways to read in data:

1)  read the file from your data folder

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

2)  download the file in-code and then read in

```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/main/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")

gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

3)  read directly from the internet

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/main/data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Lasty, if you have a file type you're not sure about (SAS, SPSS, etc)
you can use the 'Import Dataset'from the RStudio interface.

![Import Dataset interface](images/data-import.jpg)

## Examine your dataset using the str() and summary() functions

**str()** or allows you to get a compact look at the layout or
*structure* of your dataset

```{r}
str(gapminder)

```

**List out the column names**

```{r}
colnames(gapminder)
```

**summary(*object*)** is another way to examine your dataset. It gives
you numeric, tabular, or descriptive summary of each column.

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

You can also summarize a column:

```{r}
head(summary(gapminder$country), n=15)
```

### Other functions you can use to examine data:

(demo) typeof(object$column)

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
```

Use **str()** on a column: **str(country\$year)**

We can also interrogate the data frame for information about its
dimensions; remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704
observations of 6 variables in gapminder, what do you think the
following will produce, and why?

```{r}
length(gapminder)  
```

### Get the number of Rows and Columns

**nrow(gapminder)**

**ncol(gapminder)**

**dim(gapminder)** to get both rows and colums

### Display the beginning or end of a dataset

Recall from the shell lesson the head() and tail() functions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
```

## Subsetting your data

### Subsetting Operators

Why subset?

**Elements can be accessed by their indices**

**Remember: R starts at 1 (not 0) so the first index is 1**

Try this: essentially get me the nth element

```{r}
head(gapminder[1])  
```

1st column

And then:

```{r}
head(gapminder[1,1])   
```

1st column, first element

**Multiple elements: accessing two or more columns**

```{r}
head(gapminder[c(1, 3)])   
```

### Slice all of a specific row

```{r}
gapminder[3, ]
```

### Slice all of a specific column

```{r}
head(gapminder[ , 3])
```

**Slice to access multiple consecutive columns**

```{r}
head(gapminder[1:4])
```

**Question: what happens if you ask for an index that doesn't exist?**\
Try 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder[1:8]
```


**how would you check to see what the size of the dataset is?**

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```

### Subsetting by name

**create a subset of country, population and gdpPercap data**

```{r}
head(gapminder[c("country", "pop", "gdpPercap")])
```

I've been using the head() function to only display the first 10
(default number) of rows.

Another way to look at a section of the dataset is:

```{r}
gapminder[1:15,]
```

Explain the syntax example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder[1:3, 5]   

gapminder[1:3, ]   
```

### Other ways to extract based on values

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80, ]
```

But you won't see the countries, so

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80, 1:5]
```

or to get all the columns

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80,]
```

### Extract specific rows

```{r}

gapminder[c(1:9, 19:23),]
```

### Subset by logical operators:

```{r}
head(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1957,] )
```

### AND OR

```{r}
head(gapminder[gapminder$year > 1957 | gapminder$year < 1987, ])
```

or

```{r}
head(gapminder[gapminder$year %in% c(1957, 1987),])
```

```{r}
head(gapminder[gapminder$year > 1957 | gapminder$year < 1987 | gapminder$lifeExp < 60 , ])
```

### Save subset as data frame 

**Right now these subset only print to the screen, save as a separate frame**

```{r}
mySlice <- gapminder[gapminder$year > 1957 | gapminder$year < 1987 | gapminder$lifeExp < 60 , ]  
```

### Adding or Removing columns

Up to now we have been displaying slices of a dataframe, gapminder, not
actually adding or removing columns. Acting on our dataframe doesn't
change the original data so it is possible to add or delete without
impacting your oridinal dataset. 

### Add a column

```{r}
medianAge <- gapminder$lifeExp

# this one dosn't work
# cbind(gapminder, medianAge)

gapminder <- cbind(gapminder, medianAge)

colnames(gapminder)
```

Another way to add a column - in this case a copy: 

```{r}
gapminder$medianAge <- gapminder$lifeExp
```

Tomorrow Maddi & Jamie will show you other ways to add columns using a dataframe manipulation tool called `dplyr`. 

### Remove a column

```{r}
# this also didn't work as-is so I added gapminder <- 
gapminder <- gapminder[ , -7]

colnames(gapminder)
```

### Add a row

```{r}
newRow <-  gapminder[47, ]

gapminder <- rbind(gapminder, newRow)

tail(gapminder)
```

### Remove a row

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder[-1705, ]

tail(gapminder)
```

## Vector & Data Frames - Breakout room 

In breakout rooms, work in teams. Choose one person to share their screen and the other participants tell the person sharing their screen how to work through the examples. 

### Challenge 7

Start by making a vector with the numbers 1 through 26. Multiply the vector by 2, and give the resulting vector names A through Z (hint: there is a built in vector called LETTERS)

## Challenge 8
It’s good practice to also check the last few lines of your data and some in the middle. How would you do this?

Searching for ones specifically in the middle isn’t too hard, but we could ask for a few lines at random. How would you code this? HINT: look for help on the function sample: `?sample`

### Solutions: 
To check the last few lines it’s relatively simple as R already has a function for this:

```
tail(gapminder)
tail(gapminder, n = 15)
```

What about a few arbitrary rows just in case something is odd in the middle?

```
gapminder[sample(nrow(gapminder), 5), ]
```

## Challenge 9
Read the output of str(gapminder) again; this time, use what you’ve learned about factors and vectors, as well as the output of functions like colnames and dim to explain what everything that str prints out for gapminder means. If there are any parts you can’t interpret, discuss with your neighbors!

## Challenge 10

 Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

 1. Extract observations collected for the year 1957

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
    ```

 2. Extract all columns except 1 through to 4

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder[,-1:4]
    ```

 3. Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer the 80 years

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp  80]
    ```

 4. Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns
   (`continent` and `lifeExp`).

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder[1, 4, 5]
    ```

 5. Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002
    and 2007

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | 2007,]
    ```

## Solution to challenge 10
 
Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:
 
1. Extract observations collected for the year 1957
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
     # gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
     gapminder[gapminder$year == 1957,]
```
 
2. Extract all columns except 1 through to 4

```{r, eval=FALSE}
     # gapminder[,-1:4]
     gapminder[,-c(1:4)]
```
 
3. Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer than 80 years
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
     # gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp  80]
     gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp  80,]
```
 
4. Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns
    (`continent` and `lifeExp`).
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
     # gapminder[1, 4, 5]
     gapminder[1, c(4, 5)]
```
 
5. Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002
     and 2007
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

## Challenge 11

 1. Why does `gapminder[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from `gapminder[1:20, ]`?


 2. Create a new `data.frame` called `gapminder_small` that only contains rows 1 through 9
 and 19 through 23. You can do this in one or two steps.

## Solution to challenge 11
 
  1.  `gapminder` is a data.frame so needs to be subsetted on two dimensions. `gapminder[1:20, ]` subsets the data to give the first 20 rows and all columns.
 
  2. 
 
  ```{r}
  gapminder_small <- gapminder[c(1:9, 19:23),]
  ```

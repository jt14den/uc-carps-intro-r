## Icebreaker for class 


## Motivation 

* Research is a multistage process
* We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. 
* This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing population information for many countries through time. 
* By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!


## Setup 

### Do you have RStudio & R installed? 

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Intro to RStudio

## Workflow in RStudio 

### Two main styles: 

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later.
1. Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio’s short cut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.

Let's start off testing n playing and then transition to working in scripts

## Using R as a calculator

Simplest thing is math: 

```{r}
1 + 100

```

Like bash if you type incomplete command, R will wait for you to complete:

```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 
```

If you want to cancel out of this, hit the <kbd>esc</kbd>. 

## Math Functions 

Hey what if i want to add up some numbers?

## Comparing things 

We can also do comparisons in R:


```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```
```{r}
1 < 2  # less than

```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

```{r}
0.1 == 0.1
```

## Project Management With RStudio

* create a new RStudio project and initialize a git repo, 
* but I didn’t talk in a ton of details about projects and didn’t use ProjectTemplate

## Variables and assignment

* skip vectorization & managing your environment 

## R Packages

* Quiz 1 


## Data Structures (only creating vectors with c())
* Skipped most of Data Structures, but did cover creating vectors with c()

## Dataframes 


Kwoo: 

I recently taught a morning of R and did something similar. I was teaching to mostly novices and I wanted to make sure I got to plotting by the end of the morning, so this is what I did:

* Covered most of the Intro lesson except the “Vectorization” section
   * Before variables & assignment I did a little of the Project Management section — had them create a new RStudio project and initialize a git repo, but I didn’t talk in a ton of details about projects and didn’t use ProjectTemplate
   * Then I went back to the intro, created a script and explained what that was, and continued with variables and assignment, writing all commands in the script and sending them to the console as I went
* Skipped the Seeking Help section but covered some of the contents at various other points
* Skipped most of Data Structures, but did cover creating vectors with c()
* Skipped most of Exploring Data Frames until the “Realistic example” section, then adlibbed a little about what data frames are
* Condensed the Subsetting lesson and didn’t cover factor, matrix, or list subsetting.
* Went through the Creating Publication-Quality Graphics lesson, which took less than the estimated 1:20 so I threw in some additional material on the fly (box plots, facet_grid, how to save plots).
* Basically I avoided lists and matrices completely, which seemed reasonable for a novice audience. I checked in midway through with a makeshift poll in the etherpad, and most people said the pace was good. A few thought it was too slow and no one thought it was too fast.

There was a second half-day of R that I wasn't there for, so I'm not sure what they got through in that session.

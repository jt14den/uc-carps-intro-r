## Icebreaker for class

## Motivation

-   Research is a multistage process
-   We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
    how to plot results graphically.
-   This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing
    population information for many countries through time.
-   By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot
    the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!

## Setup

### Do you have RStudio & R installed?

-   [Download and install the latest version of R
    here](https://www.r-project.org/)
-   [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Intro to RStudio

Workflow in RStudio

### Two main styles:

1.  Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a
    .R file to run later.
2.  Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the
    Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified
    lines to the interactive R console.

Let's start off testing n playing and then transition to working in
scripts

## Using R as a calculator

Simplest thing is math:

```{r}
1 + 100

```

Like bash if you type incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete:

```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 
```

If you want to cancel out of this, hit the <kbd>esc</kbd>.

## Math Functions

Hey what if i want to add up some numbers?

![Functions in
R](https://science.nu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-8.png) \#\#
Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than

```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

```{r}
0.1 == 0.1
```

## Project Management: RStudio

-   The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
    start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
    eventually everything is a bit mixed together.
-   Projects can get really messy:

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/bad_layout.png)
\* A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier: \* It
will help ensure the integrity of your data; \* It makes it simpler to
share your code with someone else (a lab-mate, collaborator, or
supervisor); \* It allows you to easily upload your code with your
manuscript submission; \* It makes it easier to pick the project back up
after a break. \* One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio
is its project management functionality. \* We'll be using this today to
create a self-contained, reproducible project.

### Challenge 1: Creating a self-contained project

We're going to create a new project in RStudio:

1.  Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2.  Click "New Directory".
3.  Click "New Project".
4.  Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g.
    "my_project".
5.  If available, select the checkbox for "Create a git repository."
6.  Click the "Create Project" button.

-   simplest way to open rstudio and a project is thru your file system
    by double clicking on the `.Rproj` file in your poject folder.

### Challenge 2: Opening an RStudio project through the file system

1.  Exit RStudio.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you created a project in
    Challenge 1.
3.  Double click on the .Rproj file in that directory.

-   now we have our project set up we can create an R script!
-   Go to <kbd>File</kbd><kbd>New File</kbd><kbd>R Script</kdb>
-   ok who can tell me what a R Script is for?
-   yes, we write our R code in it and it lets us run that code in a few
    ways
-   we save our code in the file, etc.
-   let's add some code and learn how to use R Scripts in RStudio

## Variables and assignment

-   We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`,
    like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

-   note that it doesn't print anything out to the console.
-   stored it for later in something called a **variable**. `x` now
    contains the value 0.025:

```{r}
x
```

-   the stored value is a decimal approximation of this fraction called
    a floating point number.

-   did you notice anything change in the RStudio interface when we
    saved the variable?

    -   type into the chat what you noticed

-   Yes, under the Environment tab on the right we see `x` was added
    with it's stored values

-   We can use our variable in a function

```{r}
log(x)
```

-   Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

-   x used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

-   Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to, like
    so:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

-   The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.

-   The right hand side is fully evaluated before the assignment occurs.

-   Variable names:

    -   Can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no
        spaces.
    -   They must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter
        (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore).
    -   **Variables beginning with a period are hidden variables**.

-   Different people use different conventions for long variable names,
    these include:

> periods.between.words underscores_between_words
> camelCaseToSeparateWords

-   What you use is up to you, but be consistent.

It is also possible to use the = operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

-   this is much less common in the R community. but be consistent

## R Packages

-   how to load and a challenge to load packages we'll need today and
    tomorrow
-   It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
    obtaining a package written by someone else.
-   As of this writing, there are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN
    (the comprehensive R archive network).
-   R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:
-   You can see what packages are installed by typing
    installed.packages()
-   You can install packages by typing install.packages("packagename"),
    where packagename is the package name, in quotes.
-   You can update installed packages by typing update.packages()
-   You can remove a package with remove.packages("packagename")
-   You can make a package available for use with library(packagename)
-   Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages
    tab of the lower right panel in RStudio.
-   Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with
    a checkbox next to them.
-   If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded
    and if it is empty, the package is not loaded.
-   Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to
    detach that package.
-   Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the
    Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.

Let's work thru some

### Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin
```

### Challenge 2

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the
following program?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

### Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare
mass to age. Is mass larger than age?

### Challenge 5

Install the following packages: ggplot2, plyr, gapminder

## Data Structures

### Data types in R

-   variables we create have types:
-   we can find out this by using `typeof()`:

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(3.14)
```

-   There are 5 main types: double, integer, complex, logical and
    character.

```{r}
typeof(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
```

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
```

```{r}
typeof('bannana')
```

### Vectors

-   Working with a single value is one thing, but in R we are typically
    working with collections of values in something like a speadsheet
-   R lets us put a column of values together in something called a
    `vector`
-   vectors in R are foundational
-   Let's meet this vector
-   We can create a vector
-   I'll use the `c()` to create one

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 4, 5)
my_vector
```

-   A vector in R is an ordered list of things, with the special
    condition that everything in the vector must be the same basic data
    type.
-   If you don't choose the datatype in the vector function, it'll
    default to logical; or, you can declare an empty vector of whatever
    type you like.

```{r}
another_vector <- c('Tim', 'Jamie', 'Maddi')
another_vector
```

-   You can check if something is a vector:

```{r}
str(another_vector)
```

-   this command indicates the basic data type found in this vector - in
    this case chr, character;

-   an indication of the number of things in the vector - actually, the
    indexes of the vector, in this case [1:3];

-   and a few examples of what's actually in the vector - in this case
    empty character strings. If we similarly do

-   **Given what we've learned so far, what do you think the following
    will produce?**

```{r}
quiz_vector <- c(2,6,'3')
quiz_vector
```

```{r}
str(quiz_vector)
```

-   why do you think R did this?

-   yes, vectors in R need to be of the same type & R will coerce them

-   This is something called type coercion, and it is the source of many
    surprises and the reason why we need to be aware of the basic data
    types and how R will interpret them.

-   When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to be
    combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same
    type. Consider:

-   The coercion rules go: `logical` -\> `integer` -\> `numeric` -\>
    `complex` -\> `character`, where -\> can be read as are transformed
    into. You can try to force coercion against this flow using the as.

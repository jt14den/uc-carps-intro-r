## Icebreaker for class 


## Motivation 

* Research is a multistage process
* We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. 
* This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing population information for many countries through time. 
* By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!


## Setup 

### Do you have RStudio & R installed? 

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Intro to RStudio

## Workflow in RStudio 

### Two main styles: 

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later.
1. Start writing in a .R file and use RStudioâ€™s short cut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.

Let's start off testing n playing and then transition to working in scripts

## Using R as a calculator

Simplest thing is math: 

```{r}
1 + 100

```

Like bash if you type incomplete command, R will wait for you to complete:

```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 
```

If you want to cancel out of this, hit the <kbd>esc</kbd>. 

## Math Functions 

Hey what if i want to add up some numbers?

## Comparing things 

We can also do comparisons in R:


```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```
```{r}
1 < 2  # less than

```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

```{r}
0.1 == 0.1
```
